# Blockchain-Based-Mobile-Crowdsensing-Platform

Repository used during grad school for a CSC 798 Graduate Project in Computer Science course.

For the semester we focused on implementing a blockchain based mobile crowdsensing platform.

The files contained in this repository are misc files used throughout the semester to help with building the platform - most were used to learn the Solidity language along with utilizing the Hardhat Ethereum development environment.
